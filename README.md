This program was made to show us how Novamar Insurance appears on search engines across the world to the average user.

This leverages the OpenVPN protocol and selenium automation browser technologies to achieve and maintain anonymity across all searches. No leaks, period.

This program is designed to extract screenshots from google searches for Novamar and saves the output in two formats:

- PDF file
- Web page

This also automatically handles connecting and disconnecitng the VPN after each search.

A new "fake user agent" gets assigned to every new search to maintain anonymity.
